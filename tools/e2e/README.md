# owner.mjs: the owner from a command line

One file, no dependencies, Node 22 or newer. It connects to the hub's local link (`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/link`) as the
owner's human channel: the same connection a phone makes, to say things, read what comes back, answer cards and call words.
Build it from the repository with `node tools/e2e/build-owner.mjs` (the built file is committed; a test fails when it is
out of date). Source: `owner.ts`. Test: `packages/core/test/edges/owner-cli/owner.test.ts`.

## How it is let in

There is one way in, and the tool uses it as it is (SPEC-03 §2.2, "local" row):

1. `Authorization: Bearer <local token>`: the hub makes this token each time it starts and hands it, with the port, to the
   hand app only (`hands.handoff`, then `IHand.attach` over Binder). It lives in memory; it is not in `host.json`, a log or a file.
2. A signature over the hub's challenge with this client's own key (ECDSA P-256). The key is made on first use and kept in
   `--state` (default `~/.ash-owner/identity.json`, mode 600); the hub registers the channel under it (`paired_by=local`),
   and the owner can list or revoke it like any hand (`service:devices`).

There is no test mode, no switch and no environment variable that skips either check. A wrong token is closed with 4001.

**Consequence for an `adb forward`:** the forwarded connection reaches the hub as a loopback connection, but loopback alone
is not trusted: without the token it is refused. Nothing on the phone gives the token to an adb shell, on purpose. So the
tool needs the token from somewhere the owner chose to put it (`--token-file`, `--token-stdin`); see "Where the token
comes from" below.

## Use

```
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token say "你好"
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token watch 120
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token answer <card id> once
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token call service:admin status
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token call service:history query '{"limit":20}'
owner.mjs --port 8765 --token-file ./token set-key < deepseek-key.txt
```

Connection: `--port N` (or `--url ws://127.0.0.1:N/link`; env `ASH_OWNER_PORT`), the token from `--token-file PATH`
(env `ASH_OWNER_TOKEN_FILE`) or `--token-stdin` (first line). Or both at once from `--link-file PATH` (env
`ASH_OWNER_LINK_FILE`): the `{port, token}` JSON a debug build of the phone app writes (see "On a phone or emulator");
`--port`, `--url` and the token options, when given, win over it. The token and any key are **never arguments**: arguments
land in the shell history and in `ps`. `--state DIR` keeps the identity key (one hand per state dir); `--name` names the channel.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `say "<text>"` | Sends the text to `agent:main` (`--to agent:x` for another), waits for this round's answer (`say`, `show`, `ask` for the owner), then for `--settle` seconds (default 1.5) of quiet for more bubbles, and prints them. Ends at once on a question waiting for the owner. `--timeout` (default 120 s) gives up with exit 2. `--all` prints every ledger message that arrives, not only those for the owner. |
| `watch [seconds]` | Prints everything that arrives: ledger messages, cards, questions, and `present` frames (notification, status). Default 60 s, 0 = until Ctrl-C. Declares the `chat` and `notification` surfaces (`--surfaces` to change). |
| `answer <id> <option> [text]` | `<id>` is the message id (or seq) of a card. An approval or a question (`ask` line): sends the owner's answer (`once`, `always`, `deny`, or a question's option; free text for cards that allow it). An option card (`card` line): picks that option for the agent that showed it. A second answer to the same card is refused (exit 3). |
| `call <member> <word> ['<json>' \| - \| @file]` | Calls a word as the owner and prints the result. The body is a JSON object: in the argument, on standard input (`-`) or in a file (`@path`). |
| `set-key [REF]` | `service:vault/set` for `REF` (default `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`), the key from `--key-file PATH` or standard input; nothing of it is printed. |
| `script <file.json>` | A debug hub only. Sends the script to `agent:script` (an agent that makes the calls the script lists, without a model), plays the owner's side while it runs (answering cards, looking at the phone), and checks what must hold. Exit 0 all held, 4 something did not, 2 the reports did not come in time. See [DEVICE-VERIFICATION.md](DEVICE-VERIFICATION.md) and the scripts in `scripts/`. |

### Setting the model key

The owner's word is **`service:vault/set`** with `{ref, value}`; `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is the ref the hub's agents and small
model read (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter). It is owner-only and local-only: it works only from a channel on the same
machine, which this tool is (local token). Through a relay the hub refuses it.

```
owner.mjs --port N --token-file T set-key < /path/to/deepseek-key.txt        # DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
owner.mjs --port N --token-file T set-key OPENROUTER_API_KEY --key-file k.txt
owner.mjs --port N --token-file T call service:vault list                     # configured: true/false, never a value
```

`call service:vault set '{"ref":"…","value":"…"}'` also works but puts the key in the arguments; use `set-key`, or
`call service:vault set -` with the JSON on standard input. The choice of the main model is a separate word:
`call service:admin model.set '{"provider":"deepseek","model":"…"}'`.

## Output

One line per event on standard output, each starting with a UTC time with milliseconds, then a kind and `key=value`
fields (values with spaces are JSON-quoted). Easy to grep:

```
2026-10-10T15:52:36.491Z conn state=welcomed hand=RxOI… client=client:4puy… local=true
2026-10-10T15:52:36.586Z sent seq=22 id=m_Ny0h… to=agent:main
2026-10-10T15:52:36.943Z msg seq=27 id=m_gFJI… from=agent:main to=person:owner mkind=request word=say text=你好，我在。
2026-10-10T15:52:38.493Z done replies=1 waited_ms=1907
```

Kinds: `conn`, `sent`, `msg` (a message), `card` (an option card: `options=a:text,b:text`), `ask` (an approval or a question:
`options=once:…,always:…,deny:…`), `present`, `history` (`--history N`), `result` (of `call`), `answered`, `timeout`, `done`,
`error`. `--json` prints one JSON object per line (`at`, `kind`, the same fields, and `raw` for the ledger message or frame).

Exit codes: 0 done; 1 cannot connect or refused (4001: wrong token; 4003: revoked); 2 `say` got no reply in time;
3 the hub refused or failed a word; 64 usage.

## Where the token comes from

Only the hand app holds it. What is available without touching the hub:

- On a machine where the hub runs as a plain process (tests, `startHub` with a fake host), the host's `hands.handoff` call
  carries it: that is how `packages/core/test/scenarios` and this tool's test get it.
- On a phone, nothing hands it to an outside process, with one exception that exists only in a **debuggable** build of
  the hand app (see "On a phone or emulator" below).
- A relay (a computer paired with `web_ui`) is the other formal door for a remote owner; it gives the human channel with
  `local=false`, so `say`, `answer` and most `call`s work but the local-only words (`vault/set`, `admin/pause`, `admin/logs`) are refused.
  This tool does not speak the relay.

## On a phone or emulator (debuggable build only)

A debuggable build of the hand app (`ai.ash.agent`, `assembleDebug`) writes the connection it was handed to its own
private directory, each time the kernel host attaches: `files/debug/local-link.json`, mode 0600, `{"port":…,"token":"…","at":<ms>}`.
It is replaced atomically when the token changes, and deleted when the kernel host lets go of the hand app (unbinds) and
when the app process starts again. A release build never writes it: the code is off unless both `BuildConfig.DEBUG` and the
package's `FLAG_DEBUGGABLE` are set, and only a debuggable package can be read with `run-as`, so a release build adds no way in.

```
adb shell run-as ai.ash.agent cat files/debug/local-link.json > link.json && chmod 600 link.json
PORT=$(node -p 'require("./link.json").port')
adb forward tcp:$PORT tcp:$PORT                     # same number on both sides, so --link-file alone is enough
node tools/e2e/owner.mjs --link-file link.json say "你好"
```

If the local port must differ, forward `adb forward tcp:<local> tcp:<port>` and add `--port <local>`; the token still comes
from the file. Without `--link-file`, take `port` and `token` out of the JSON yourself, keep the token in a 0600 file and give
that to `--token-file` (`node -p 'require("./link.json").token' > token && chmod 600 token`). Remember the token is never an argument.

**The token changes every time the hub starts** (a phone restart, the kernel host restarting the hub, a reinstall). After
that, `link.json` is stale and the hub closes the connection with 4001: read the file from the phone again. If the file is
missing, the kernel host has not attached yet (or has let go): open the app and wait for it to say it is connected.
The file holds the token in clear, so keep your copy private and delete it when you are done.

# 真机场景 (real-phone scenarios): `scenarios.mjs`

One more file with no dependencies (Node 22 or newer), next to `owner.mjs`. It is the old real-phone regression
(`tools/regress.sh` R1-R21) and the key use scenarios of `spec/REGRESSION-0.3.md` rewritten for the new hub, as scripts that
run on the machine that has adb (a MacBook with the phone or emulator attached). There is nothing to build: copy
`owner.mjs` and `scenarios.mjs` into one folder and run it.

```
adb devices                                    # the serial
node scenarios.mjs --serial <serial> --link-file link.json                 # everything
node scenarios.mjs --serial <serial> --link-file link.json --only R19,S085 # some
node scenarios.mjs --list                                                   # what there is
```

Before you start: a **debuggable** build of the hand app (`assembleDebug`, so that `run-as` works), the app has connected
(the kernel attached: open it once and wait for it to say so), the phone is awake and not behind a PIN (the script sends
WAKEUP and dismisses the keyguard, which a PIN refuses), and for the scenarios that talk to the agent a model key is set.

What it does with `adb` and `owner.mjs`:

- **The link.** `run-as ai.ash.agent cat files/debug/local-link.json` is written to `--link-file` (mode 600) and the port is
  forwarded (`adb forward`). The token changes every time the hub starts, so the script reads it again whenever a call is
  refused or the hub is not there, and after every scenario that restarts the hub. Nothing else is needed from you.
- **Acting.** Words are called as the owner (`owner.mjs call`), the agent is spoken to with `say`, and the phone is touched
  with `input keyevent`, `monkey`, `cmd statusbar`, `cmd notification post`. The state it changes (approval mode, the
  phone's trust tier, settings, timers, test apps, a sub-agent) it puts back, also when the scenario fails.
- **Judging.** Only facts: the ledger (`service:history/query` after a marker: which word was called and on which member,
  whether a card came and with which options, the answer code of a request, turn lanes and outcomes), the phone's own report
  (`config.status`), `dumpsys window` (foreground package), `dumpsys notification` (what was posted), `dumpsys meminfo`,
  `ps` (the hub and DSH). It never judges what the agent says. Anything that goes through the model is asked for in a way that
  forces one word ("call `clipboard.set` with ..."), and the verdict is whether that word was called.

Output is one line per scenario, `PASS|FAIL|SKIP|MANUAL <id> <name> -- <detail>`, then `SUMMARY`. Exit code 0 when nothing
FAILed, 1 otherwise, 2 when it could not start (no adb, no device, no link), 64 for bad arguments.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PASS` / `FAIL` | Judged by facts. A FAIL also leaves `<shots>/<id>-fail.png`. |
| `SKIP` | A need is missing; the line says what to switch on (the table below), or the situation could not be made (for example the model was too fast for "busy"). |
| `MANUAL` | The automatic part ran and its result is in the line; the rest needs an eye. The screenshots are in `--shots` (default `./shots`), named after the scenario: `S114-running.png`. |

Options: `--only LIST` (ids, old numbers, categories, `all`), `--skip LIST`, `--safe` (leave out what kills a process),
`--shots DIR`, `--report FILE` (JSON), `--timeout-scale X` (slow phone or network), `--alt-model provider/model` (S157),
`--manual-wait S` (S033 waits this long for the tap on the notification, 0 = no wait), `--package`, `--kernel-package`,
`--owner`, `--adb`, `--state`. `node scenarios.mjs --help` has the rest. The scenarios that kill the hub or DSH run last.

## The scenarios

Each is named by the old number it replaces (`R` is `tools/regress.sh`, `S` is REGRESSION-0.3; the third column is what else it covers).

## What the phone must allow (`SKIP` tells you which)

The hand app reports its own switches (`config.status`); a scenario that needs one that is `missing` is skipped with the line
below. Replace `$S` by the serial and `ai.ash.agent` by `--package` if you changed it.

| Need (`config.status` item) | Scenarios | How to switch it on |
|---|---|---|
| `calendar` | S086 | `adb -s $S shell pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.READ_CALENDAR` (and `WRITE_CALENDAR`) |
| `location` | S087 | `pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`); an emulator also needs a fix: `adb -s $S emu geo fix 121.47 31.23` |
| `location_background` | (reading in the background) | `pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` |
| `activity_recognition` | activity sense | `pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` |
| `photos` | S088 | `pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` (Android 13+, else `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`), and `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` |
| `all_files` | files outside the media folders | `adb -s $S shell appops set ai.ash.agent MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE allow` |
| `notifications` | S075, S033 | `pm grant ai.ash.agent android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` |
| `notification_listener` and the in-app opt-in | S089 | `adb -s $S shell cmd notification allow_listener ai.ash.agent/ai.ash.caps.senses.NotificationSense`; the opt-in (通知读取) is a switch in the app, no adb command |
| `accessibility` | S094b | `adb -s $S shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services ai.ash.agent/ai.ash.caps.screen.A11yService` and `settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1` |
| `usage_access` | app usage | `adb -s $S shell appops set ai.ash.agent GET_USAGE_STATS allow` |
| `overlay` | the island | `adb -s $S shell appops set ai.ash.agent SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow` |
| `write_settings` | settings words | `adb -s $S shell appops set ai.ash.agent WRITE_SETTINGS allow` |
| `exact_alarm` | exact reminders | `adb -s $S shell appops set ai.ash.agent SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM allow` |
| `battery_optimization` | staying alive | `adb -s $S shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +ai.ash.agent` (and `+ai.ash.kernel`) |
| `host_shell` | S094c | pair 「后台也能动手」 in Ash's checkup; on a test phone the service can be started over USB with the line in `REMEDY.host_shell` (`tools/e2e/scenarios.mjs`) |

Other needs: a **paired phone** (`phone`: the device is online in `service:devices/list`), a **model key** (`llm`:
`owner.mjs set-key DEEPSEEK_API_KEY < key.txt`), **internet on the phone** (`network`: S093, S094), the **process** can be
killed (`kill`: `run-as ai.ash.kernel kill -9` works on a debuggable kernel build, or use an emulator/rooted shell).
The permission dialogs that `pm grant` cannot reach (accessibility on some makers' ROMs, the notification opt-in, the
battery whitelists of MIUI/ColorOS) are done by hand once.

## Tests of the script

`node --test tools/e2e/scenarios.test.mjs` judges recorded samples (`tools/e2e/fixtures/`: output of `owner.mjs`, ledgers of an
approval, a refusal, a stop, a failed turn with its retry card, busy supplements, a sub-agent whose background turn is refused;
`dumpsys` window/notification/meminfo/battery, `ps`) and drives the runner with stand-ins for adb and `owner.mjs`; it needs no
device. `packages/core/test/edges/owner-cli/scenarios.test.ts` runs the real script against a real hub with a fake `adb`
(fetching the link, the approval flow, pause and resume, sub-agents, an option card, stop and busy messages).
