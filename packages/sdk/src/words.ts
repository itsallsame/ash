/**
 * The service words: the one list of every word the hub's members speak, apart from the standard hand actions
 * (namespaces.ts) and app tools (app.ts). It covers the services (SPEC-02 §4.1), the owner's words (§4.2), the words
 * every agent speaks, `service:llm/complete`, and the events. Contracts only; nothing here runs.
 *
 * `callers` defaults to owner, agent, app (SPEC-01 §5.2). Words that are not default are listed in the callers snapshot
 * (test/callers.snapshot.txt) so a review sees every change. Events are always `kernel`: they are sent by the hub's
 * own edges and services (the human module, the hands module, the agents module), never by an agent or an app.
 * An agent's name never appears here; `agent:*` stands for every declared agent.
