/**
 * The agent driver contract (SPEC-08): what the hub's agents module asks of one agent runtime, and what the runtime
 * reports back. One driver serves every agent declared on its runtime kind (`dsh`, `codex`, `claude`...). A driver
 * in the hub's process is called directly; a driver on a computer is the same interface carried over the link
 * protocol's `agent` channel, so the hub's code does not tell them apart.
 *
 * The hub decides *when* (the inbox, quota, which messages go together); the driver decides *how* for its runtime
 * (start the process, put the message in the agent's own words, keep the session). Session handles are opaque: the
 * hub stores them and gives them back, never reads them.
 *
 * Errors are `WordError`: `conflict` when the agent is busy and the operation needs it idle, `unavailable` when the
 * runtime cannot do it, `failed` when it tried and could not, `not_found` for an agent or lane the driver does not hold.
