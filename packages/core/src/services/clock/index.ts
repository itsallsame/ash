/**
 * `service:clock`: durable timers (HUB-MODULES §3).
 *
 *   set    {at?, every?, to, word, body, label}   store a timer; `at` is Unix ms, `every` seconds (at least 60)
 *   cancel {id}        -> {cancelled, inflight?}: `inflight: true` is a one-time timer whose send is already out; that send is
 *                         delivered if it succeeds, and only the put-back for another try is stopped
 *   list
 *   wake.fired (event, from the host module)       the phone's alarm went off: look for due timers
 *
 * A timer sends its stored word to its target as whoever set it, never as `service:clock`: `set` keeps the caller
 * (member, via, local) and the word goes through the router, the callers check and the gate with that identity when it
 * is due. An agent's timer therefore asks the owner at that time like any call of the agent; an app's timer needs the
 * app's grant; the owner's timer is the owner's; a hub service's timer (the semantic layer's pulse) stays a service's.
 * The turn is not kept: it is over by then. `cancel` takes back one's own timer; the owner may take back any.
 * `cancel.owner` (the hub only) takes back all of one member's timers.
 * (The agents module calls it when an agent is deleted, the apps module when an app is removed or loses all its grants.)
 * As a second line, a timer an agent or an app set that cannot be sent because the setter is gone (the refusal is followed by
 * `service:agents/describe` or `service:apps/apps.describe`, see `dropIfGone`) takes all of that member's timers back, with a
 * log line. A member that is only stopped, restarting or disabled is still known, so its timers stay.
 * A one-time timer whose send is refused with `unavailable` or `offline` (the target or the setter is only away: the apps are
 * still loading, an agent is restarting) is put back under the same id for RETRY_AFTER_MS later, RETRY_MAX times at most, so the
 * reminder is not lost; so is one whose app setter is installed and enabled but not running yet. `not_found` / `granted: false`
 * from the second line above still take it (and the setter's other timers) back. A repeating timer just loses that round.
 * `at` alone fires once; `every`
 * repeats; both together fire first at `at` and then every period. A repeating timer that was missed (the phone
 * slept, the hub was down) fires once for the missed rounds and goes on from the next slot after now. Precision is
 * the scan period, not the second.
 *
 * The timers live in the ledger's database (table `timers`), so they survive a restart. While the hub is up they are
 * driven by one in-process timeout. The earliest due time is also given to the host as its alarm
 * (`service:host/wake.at`, only the earliest is kept; `wake.clear` when none is left) so a sleeping phone wakes the
 * hub. Sends are not waited for: a target that answers slowly holds up nobody else.
