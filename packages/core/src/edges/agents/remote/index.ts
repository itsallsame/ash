/**
 * Remote drivers (HUB-MODULES §2.5, SPEC-08 §1.2): Codex, Claude Code and WorkBuddy run on a computer, and the computer
 * program carries them to the hub over the `agent` channel (SPEC-03 §6). Here they are ordinary `AgentDriver`s.
 *
 * Assembly:
 * ```ts
 * const remote = createRemoteDrivers({ router, log });
 * linkServer.onChannel("agent", remote.attach);
 * createAgents({ ..., drivers: { dsh: ..., ...remote.factories } });
 * ```
 * Which computer an agent runs on is its declaration's `native.on`; a computer that is not connected (or does not offer
 * the runtime) makes `start` fail, and the agent is never moved to another body (SPEC-01 §11.1).
