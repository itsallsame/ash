/**
 * Notifications (SPEC-03 §5.4, surface `notification`): what rings on the owner's phone, and when. The conversation
 * itself is `sync`; this only decides whether a message also rings (rules in ./delivery) and builds the presentation the
 * channel shows. It is sent only to channels that declared the surface.
 *
 * A reply whose turn is still running is shown quietly; when the turn ends and the last reply of it was only shown
 * quietly, and the owner is still not looking, that notification is raised again strongly (`alert`).
