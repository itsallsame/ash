/**
 * The tool surface (HUB-MODULES §2.4, SPEC-02 §3): the one door for an agent, an MCP server on `/mcp`. A tool call
 * becomes `router.send` as the agent whose bearer token it carries, and in the turn of the lane that token was issued for;
 * nothing in the call can change either.
 *
 *   transport   Streamable HTTP (stateless), `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, no `Origin` header, calls only inside a turn
 *               (receipt tools excepted). The link server mounts `handler` at `/mcp`.
 *   tools       fixed tools = one word each; capability_list/describe/call; await_result/list_pending/cancel (tools.ts)
 *   receipts    a call that takes over 15 s answers `accepted` + `request_id`; a call the gate parks for the owner answers
 *               `waiting_owner` + `pending_id` (+ a `request_id`); both can be asked about later (jobs.ts)
 *   results     one envelope for success and failure (result.ts)
 *   come back   a receipt's answer that is still not fetched (await_result) when its turn is over is told to the agent once,
 *               as a `wake` {lane: "back", reason: "result", context: {request_id, member, word, label, outcome}}: at once if
 *               the turn is over when the answer comes, else when `turn.ended` is heard. `waiting_owner` is not told (its
 *               answer comes from service:gate). Calls a restart interrupted are told by `recover()` (result_unknown).
 *
 * Wiring: `agentPolicy` and `currentTurn` come from the agents module (the agent's declaration; the turn it is running on
 * a lane); the agents module calls `issueTokens` every time it starts an agent process and hands one token per lane to
 * the agent's driver, which gives each lane's session its own.
