# Scenario tests (T20)

Black-box acceptance of the new hub, written from outside in. Each test starts the hub with `startHub` (`packages/core/src/next.ts`)
and touches it only through what the outside world can touch:

| What the test plays | How | Where |
|---|---|---|
| the owner | `packages/link` client on the human channel of the local connection (`Authorization: Bearer <local token>`, signed challenge); `sync` gives the conversation, `present` frames are what the channel is shown | `Human` in `harness.ts` |
| a hand (phone, computer) | `packages/link` client on the device channel: signed identity, manifest, answers `call`/`assess`, sends events | `Hand` |
| an agent | `scriptedDriver()`, a fake `AgentDriver`; its tools are called on `/mcp` with the token the hub gave it in `start()` | `ScriptedDriver` |
| the host | the T15 `FakeHost` (the hub reports to it; the harness plays `wake.fired`) | `startScenario` |

The local token is read from the host's `hands.handoff` call, the way the phone app gets it. Nothing here imports a hub module,
opens the database, or reaches into the hub's internals: everything goes through `startHub` and the one port it opens.

Run: `npm run -s test:scenarios` (`npm test` runs them too; the smoke glob does not).

## How the modules map to the tests

Every test needs the hub to **start, take the owner on a human channel, run an agent and serve `/mcp`**. Call that BASE:
T2 (words), T3 (ledger), T4 (router, gate, registry), T5 (link-server, hands), T6 (human), T7 (tool surface), T15 (host),
T17 (agents + a driver). The "also needs" column lists only what a test needs on top of BASE.

## Gaps in the specs found while writing the scenarios

Decisions of the coordinator (BUILD-PROGRESS §7, "T20 发现的规格缺口和总控的决定") closed gaps 1–6 and 11; the harness follows them.

1. **Small model: decided (1).** `HubOptions.llm?: { baseUrl }` overrides the providers' addresses so a scenario can run a fake model.
   The scenarios that need one (R3 steer, R18, R22 bash review, R29, R47, R64, R77) wait for a fake model server in the harness.
2. **Seal key: decided (2).** `ASH_VAULT_SEAL_KEY` comes with the host's environment (SPEC-07). The harness passes `env` (a copy of
   what `FakeHost.writeLaunch()` gives) and `stdin` (`FakeHost.stdin`, where `FakeHost.sendEvent()` plays `wake.fired`); the hub reads
   host.json itself. No field for the key.
3. **Approval answer: decided (3).** Card options are exactly `once`, `always` (only when offered) and `deny`; the answer is the response
   to the `person:owner/ask` request, `{ok:true, result:{data:{choice}}}`; expiry is a deny. The harness answers by option id and asserts the ids.
4. **Background message: decided (4).** The initiator (only when it is an agent) gets `agent:<x>/tell` on its back lane, one sentence naming
   the request, the result and the next step. Tests assert `word === "tell"`, the receiving agent, and the `pending_id` / `setup_id` in it.
5. **Tool result envelope: decided (5).** Success = `{content, structuredContent: data}`, failure = `isError` + `structuredContent: {error}`;
   a receipt's id is `request_id` (long call) or `pending_id` (approval). `ToolResult` is `{isError, data, text}`, `errorCode` reads `data.error.code`.
6. **Driver contract: decided (6).** Full `DriverMessage`, `session.*`/`compact`/`configure`/`plugins` on `AgentDriver`, `start(spec)` with
   `tools:{mcp_url, tokens: {<lane>: token}}`, seeded `main` on runtime `dsh`. The harness registers only `dsh`; a scenario that declares another runtime lists it
   in `startScenario(t, { runtimes })`. The minimal types in `next.ts` are replaced by T17a's `sdk/driver.ts`.
7. **A computer cannot pair through the local connection.** `hello` has no field for a pairing code; pairing (`waiting → requested →
   approved → connected`) can only be driven through the gateway, so the "initiator is told at each step" rule is tested on the relay
   setup instead (`gateway.setup.start`/`cancel`, which also opens `127.0.0.1:8976`, a fixed port: scenarios using it cannot run in parallel).
8. **No way to make a non-local channel or an `agent` channel.** Everything local is `local: true`, and the `agent` channel is "not
   applicable" locally (SPEC-03 §2.2.1). `local_only`, `web_ui`, pairing from a remote page, and the remote drivers (Codex/Claude) need either
   a fake gateway in `HubOptions` (the gateway client lives in `packages/link`) or a test hook for the origin of a connection.
9. **Apps have no fixture.** Installing a test app (a directory with `app.json` + a stdio MCP server) is possible via `service:apps`, but
   nothing in SPEC-06 owns a shared fixture. R20, R23, R39, R58, R70–R74 wait for one (T7 is the natural owner).
10. **Pulse only exists with a placed widget.** SPEC-10 §3 makes pulse depend on `widget.placed` events and the schedule, so an hourly-pulse
    scenario needs the widget schema, the time zone of the host spec and the fake clock; not written yet.
11. **Unowned services: decided (11).** `service:clock` and `service:senses` are the new T21; the organ `app:sense-rules` is T19; `service:admin`
    (including the quiet-hours setting keys, gap 12) is T6. The timers, pause and senses scenarios depend on them.
12. **Quiet hours and other `admin` settings have no keys in `words.ts`** (`settings.set` is a free object), so they cannot be scripted.
13. **`sync` defaults.** SPEC-03 §5.2 does not say what a `sync` with neither `after` nor `before` returns, nor which way `before` pages. The
    harness always opens `after: 0` and pages with `before` + `limit` (the messages immediately before).
14. **Fixed waits.** Negative checks ("nothing woke the agent", "no card") use `quiet()` (300 ms); nothing that should arrive is waited for with a fixed time.
