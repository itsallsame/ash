| `pause` | owner | write / none | local_only | by | 在暂停 | Durably pause all activity (agent turns, timers that would wake an agent). Like resume, only the owner from a channel on this machine: `by` cites the one owner message that said stop. |
| `resume` | owner | write / none | local_only | confirmed* | 在恢复 | Resume after a pause. Only the owner can, from a channel on this machine, after an explicit confirmation. |
| `settings.get` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | keys | 在看设置 | Read the hub's settings (all of them, or the named keys). Credentials are never part of the result. |
| `settings.set` | owner, agent, app | write / structure | - | - | 在改设置 | Change settings: the body is the keys to change and their new values. Agents asking for this are asked about by the owner. |
| `model.set` | owner, agent, app | write / structure | - | provider*, model* | 在换主模型 | Choose the main model (provider and model name) the hub's own agents run on; restart_required says whether an agent must be restarted for it to apply. |

| `apps.describe` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id* | 在看应用详情 | One app: what it needs from ash (needs), its screens (surfaces), events and tools. |
| `apps.install` | owner, agent, app | execute / structure | - | id* | 在安装应用 | Install an app from /root/apps/<id>/ (ash's own, or one you wrote): it is checked first as apps.validate does, and a failing app is refused with the problems (error.detail.problems) before anyone is asked. Then the owner approves, on one card, everything it needs (needs); an app you wrote is shown as written by you, not published. Then its grants are stored and it starts as member app:<id>. Installing again after editing restarts it with the new files. |
| `apps.enable` | owner, agent, app | execute / structure | - | id* | 在重新启用应用 | Start an installed app that was turned off, within the grants the owner already gave. An agent's request asks the owner. |
| `apps.disable` | owner, agent, app | write / structure | - | id* | 在停用应用 | Stop an app; its grants are kept so it can be turned on again. |
| `apps.revoke` | owner, agent, app | write / structure | - | id*, need | 在收回应用的权限 | Take back one need (need: a member id such as device:<hand_id>, or notify / widgets / card), or every grant when need is left out, which stops the app. |
| `apps.refresh` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | - | 在查找新应用 | Read /root/apps again: new apps appear, removed ones stop. |
| `apps.restart` | owner, agent, app | act / none | - | id* | 在重启应用 | Restart an installed app's server so edits to its files (server.mjs, tools, app.json cards) take effect. It is checked first as apps.validate does: a failing app is not restarted and the problems come back (error.detail.problems). If app.json's needs changed, use apps.install instead (the owner approves them). Pages need no restart. |
| `apps.logs` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id*, lines | 在看应用日志 | An app's recent output: what its server wrote to stderr, protocol errors (anything but MCP on stdout), and Ash's notes on starts, exits and restarts (newest last, default 100 lines, at most 400). last_exit says how the server last ended (exit code or signal); error is why it is not running, if Ash knows. |
| `apps.reset` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | id* | 在清空应用数据 | Empty the app's data folder (app.json data_dir, e.g. /root/apps/<id>/data) and restart it, so it starts over with no data; its cards redraw. Only for an app that declares data_dir. The owner's data is gone afterwards: do it only when the owner wants it, or for an app you are still building. |
| `apps.remove` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | id*, keep_data | 在卸载应用 | Uninstall an app: stop it, drop everything the owner granted it and its home-screen cards, and delete its folder /root/apps/<id>/. keep_data: true keeps the folder (its data and files) so it can be installed again as it was. Ash's own apps cannot be removed (they come back): disable them instead. |
| `apps.contract` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | - | 在看应用契约 | The ash-app/1 contract for writing an app, in full (doc, markdown): app.json fields, how ash starts the server and talks to it, pages (ui:// resources), tools, needs, events, listens. Also the app.json JSON Schema and a small runnable example app (hello: a list with one page and four tools, the same skeleton apps.scaffold writes) with its files. The same doc and example are in the container at doc_path and example.path. |
| `apps.scaffold` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | id*, name*, summary, role, surfaces, tools | 在写应用骨架 | Write a new app's skeleton into /root/apps/<id>/ (app.json, a dependency-free server.mjs, one ui/<page>.html per surface, shared ui/app.css and ui/app.js, an empty data/ folder). It runs as it is: a small working list in data/data.json with tools <id>.list, <id>.add, <id>.done (mark done/undone), <id>.remove, and a first page with the list and done/undone toggles. Change them to what the app is about; tools you name besides those answer with a placeholder until you write them in server.mjs. role (default: summary) says what the app is for and when to use it; you and Ash see it in every conversation. surfaces default to one page home: give the app tools that read and change its data, so you can do through them everything the owner does on its pages. Refuses a folder that already has an app.json. No approval is needed: it only writes files. Then edit, apps.validate, and apps.install (the owner approves what it needs). |
| `apps.validate` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id, path | 在检查应用 | Check an app folder the way install will: app.json against the contract (each missing or wrong field by its path), the icon file, then a trial start of its server (it must start and speak MCP over stdio), its tools (names, input schemas) and every page (each surface's ui:// resource must be served as HTML). Give id (the folder /root/apps/<id>) or path (/root/apps/<folder>). ok is true when nothing would stop it from installing and opening; warnings are worth fixing but do not block. Nothing is installed or changed. |
| `apps.surface` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id*, surface* | 在取应用页面 | The page resource of one of an app's surfaces (the ui:// resource its app.json lists), for a channel to show; csp lists the domains the page declared it may connect to and load from.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `complete` | owner, agent, app | read / none | timeout 60s | model, messages*, max_tokens | 在问小模型 | A short completion from the hub's small model (the model argument is optional). For organs that must judge something in code, e.g. a sensor rule. The usage is counted against the caller and its quota. |

## `service:widgets`

| 词 | 调用方 | effect / risk | 标记 | 输入 | 进行时 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `widget.list` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | - | 在看桌面小组件 | What is on the owner's phone home screen: each placed widget (the 'ash' widget, or an 'Ash 卡片' card widget with the card it shows), and every card that exists with its owner, size, expiry, event action names and the phone's last problem drawing it (null when it drew fine or has not reported). |
| `widget.card.put` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | id*, title*, size*, a2ui*, ttl_min | 在更新桌面卡片 | Create or replace (same id) a card the owner can place on the phone home screen with the 'Ash 卡片' widget; widgets already showing it redraw. When the data belongs to an app (a todo list, health numbers…), use that app's own card instead (owner app:<id> in widget.list, drawn from the app's data and kept current; the owner places it on the home screen) — a copy of its data here goes stale. id: lowercase letters, digits, . _ - (at most 64); title: at most 40 characters. The card belongs to whoever created it: only its creator or the owner may replace or remove it. size is the intended widget size (2x2 small, 4x2 wide, 4x4 large). ttl_min: after this many minutes the card shows as expired until updated. Invalid cards are refused with the component, property and reason. The result says whether the phone drew it (phone: drawn), could not (phone: problem, with problem), or did not answer in time (unknown); a later problem (e.g. an image that failed to load) reaches you as widget.problem. When the phone can draw it, the result also carries a preview image of the card as the home screen shows it (at the widget's size, in the phone's current dark or light theme): look at it, and fix cut-off text, overflow and empty lists before telling the owner it is done. widget.card.preview shows it again later. a2ui is A2UI v0.9 (basic catalog) as a flat component list: {components:[{id, component, ...}], root?:'root', data?:{...}, sizes?, theme?:{primaryColor}}. Anything Android widgets can draw is allowed; what they cannot is refused with the reason. No limit on nesting style, number of buttons or text lines except Android's own (about 10 nested levels; a scrolling List's items get their own budget). Components: Text {text, variant: h1..h5\|body\|caption} — text keeps line breaks and emoji, and simple Markdown (**bold**, *italic*, `code`, ~~strike~~, [link](url), # heading, - list) is drawn as formatting, never shown raw. Row/Column {children, justify: start\|center\|end\|spaceBetween\|spaceAround\|spaceEvenly\|stretch, align: start\|center\|end\|stretch}; Stack {children, align} (children overlap; a child's style.place: topStart..bottomEnd); Grid {children, columns}; Card {child}; List {children, columns?} scrolls vertically when longer than the widget (horizontal lists are impossible; at most 16 Lists per layout); Tabs {tabs:[{title, child}], selected?} (switches on the phone); Spacer {size?} (flexible when no size); Divider {axis}; Image {url, fit: contain\|cover\|fill\|none\|scaleDown, variant: icon\|avatar\|smallFeature\|mediumFeature\|largeFeature\|header} with url https://… or data:image/png\|jpeg\|webp\|gif;base64,… (the phone fetches, downsizes and caches; no SVG), 'avatar' / 'avatar:<face>' (Ash), 'icon:<name>'; Icon {name: an A2UI icon name (check, close, star, favorite, home, settings, refresh, add, delete, edit, mail, phone, person, search, share, warning, info, …) or Ash's sun, cloud, rain, snow, wind, moon, heart, steps, weight, sleep, water, fire, calendar, clock, alert, bell, car, money, chart; or {svgPath}}; Button {child: any component id, variant: default\|primary\|borderless, action}; CheckBox / Switch {label, value: bool or {path}}; ChoicePicker {options:[{label, value}], value:[...] or {path}, variant: mutuallyExclusive\|multipleSelection, displayStyle: checkbox\|chips}; ProgressBar {value, max?: 100, label?}; Badge {text}; Clock {format?, timeZone?} (live); Timer {since \| until: epoch ms} (live count up/down). Not drawable in a widget (refused): Video, AudioPlayer, TextField, DateTimeInput, Slider, Modal, web pages, scripts, animation. Every component may have: weight (share of the free space in a Row/Column), visible (bool or {path}), accessibility {label}, action, and style {background, color (text/icon/tint; inherited by children), cornerRadius, padding, margin, width, height (dp \| 'fill' \| 'wrap'), fontSize (sp), fontWeight (normal\|medium\|bold\|100-900), italic, underline, strikethrough, textAlign, maxLines, ellipsize (end\|start\|middle\|none), lineHeight, letterSpacing, opacity}. Colours: '#RRGGBB', '#RRGGBBAA' (alpha last, e.g. '#000000B3' translucent dark), theme names text, textSecondary, accent, onAccent, background, surface, surfaceVariant, line, transparent, translucentDark, translucentLight, white, black, red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, pink, gray (these follow the phone's dark mode), or {light, dark}. A background on the root replaces the widget's own background (and its title). Actions (any element; in a List each item is tappable): {event:{name, context?}} — sent back to you as widget.action with the item key, checked state or chosen values; {openApp:{app, surface?}} or {functionCall:{call:'openUrl', args:{url:'ui://<app>/<surface>'}}} — opens that app's page in 「Ash 应用」; {openAsh:{}}; openUrl with https/mailto/tel/geo. A CheckBox/Switch/ChoicePicker whose value is {path} writes the owner's choice back into the card's data. Values may be literals, {path:'/a/b'} into data (relative paths inside templates), or A2UI functions {call: formatString ('${/a} ${b}') \| formatNumber \| formatCurrency \| formatDate \| pluralize \| and \| or \| not, args}. children may be a template {componentId, path:'/items'}: one copy per array element, with paths relative to the element (its id or key field is the item key in widget.action). sizes: [{width, height (dp), root}] gives other layouts for other widget sizes. Example: {components:[{id:'root',component:'Column',style:{background:'translucentDark',color:'white',padding:14},children:['t','l']},{id:'t',component:'Text',text:'**待办**',variant:'h3'},{id:'l',component:'List',children:{componentId:'row',path:'/todo'}},{id:'row',component:'CheckBox',label:{path:'title'},value:{path:'done'},action:{event:{name:'toggle'}}}],data:{todo:[{id:'a',title:'买菜',done:false}]}} |
| `widget.card.preview` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id* | 在看桌面卡片的样子 | Look at a card again: the phone draws it as the home-screen widget would (its size on this phone, in the current dark or light theme) and returns the picture as an image you can see, or says why it cannot. Use it after the owner changes theme, after an app's card refreshed, or to check a card you did not just put. fresh: false means the phone did not answer in time and the image is the last one it drew. |
| `widget.card.get` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | id* | 在看桌面卡片的内容 | Read one card back: what it says (its a2ui as it was put), size, owner, last update, the owner's answers recorded on it (feedback: what a feedback button said and when; card_updated_at tells which version of the card was answered), and the picture of how the home screen shows it now (the same image as widget.card.preview; preview_problem says why there is none). Use it to see what you showed before and how it was received; widget.list only gives titles. |
| `widget.card.validate` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | a2ui* | 在检查桌面卡片 | Check a card's a2ui exactly as widget.card.put would, without saving or showing anything: valid, or the problem (which component, which property, why). levels is how deep it nests against Android's limit. Same format as widget.card.put. |
| `widget.card.remove` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | id* | 在移除桌面卡片 | Remove a card you created (the owner may remove any). Widgets that showed it ask the owner to pick another card. |
| `widget.tap` | owner | write / none | - | card*, action, component, checked, value | 在转达小组件上的点击 | The owner tapped, toggled or chose something on a card (sent from the phone as the owner). Owner only; the card's creator is then told by widget.action. |
| `widget.placed` | kernel | read / none | event in | widgets* | 在记下放好的小组件 | The phone reports which Ash widgets are on its home screen. Sent by the hands module from the hand's event; not recorded. |
| `widget.bind` | kernel | read / none | event in | widget*, card* | 在记下小组件选的卡片 | The owner picked which card one placed 'Ash 卡片' widget shows. Sent by the hands module from the hand's event; not recorded. |
| `widget.rendered` | kernel | read / none | event in | widgets, rendered* | 在记下卡片画出来没有 | What a channel reports after being asked to show widget state: which widgets are placed and which cards it drew, with the problem or a preview picture. Turned from the channel's present result by the human module; not recorded. |
| `widget.action` | kernel | read / none | event out | card*, action*, owner*, title, component, item, checked, value, context | 在转达小组件上的点击 | The owner tapped, toggled or chose something on a home-screen card. owner is the card's creator, who decides what it means; component is the element, item the list item's key, checked / value the new state. On an app's card (owner app:<id>) the tap goes to the app's own action tool, which changes the app's data; otherwise the tap itself does nothing else. |
| `widget.state` | kernel | read / none | event out | - | 在更新桌面卡片 | The home-screen cards changed: the whole state for the channels that show widgets (the human edge pushes it as present{widget}). A channel that just connected gets the current state from service:widgets/widget.list. |
| `widget.problem` | kernel | read / none | event out | card*, owner*, title, problem* | 在转达卡片画不出来 | The phone could not fully draw a home-screen card (problem says what and why); the card's creator should fix it. |

Schedule (list of {time:'HH:MM' local, days:'daily'\|'weekdays'\|'weekends'\|[0..6 with 0 = Sunday]} or {time:{at: epoch ms}} for one moment; replaces the whole list; the next 48 hours become real timers). Other fields are refused. PULSE.md, the file that tells you how to use each wake, is in your home folder: edit it there yourself. |
| `pulse.history` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | limit, before | 在看主动更新的记录 | Page through your pulse history, newest first: wakes (why, when), what you did (pulse.note), the owner's feedback on your cards, changes to the schedule with their reasons, skipped wakes and why. limit (default 20), before: an entry id from next_before to read older ones. |
| `pulse.note` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | did*, why, kind, data_used | 在记下这次做了什么 | Record what you did on this wake and why (did, why, data_used: what you looked at). kind: pulse (default) for an ordinary wake, gap for something you wanted to know or do but could not get; gaps are collected so the missing source can be added. Nothing here ever reaches the owner. |
| `pulse.fire` | owner, agent, app | write / none | - | - | 在试一次主动更新 | Wake yourself now as a pulse to try your schedule and cards; it does not use the daily budget. Needs the pulse to be active and switched on. |

| `balance.get` | owner | read / none | - | - | 在看余额 | The provider account balance for the configured API key; fails rather than reporting zero when it cannot be read. |
| `quota.check` | kernel | read / none | - | agent* | 在查额度 | Whether an agent may open another turn under its daily quota, by the latest usage numbers. A soft limit: the numbers are only as fresh as the last poll. |
| `usage.recorded` | kernel | read / none | event in | caller*, provider*, model*, input_tokens*, output_tokens*, cost, ok*, at* | 在记下用量 | One model call, as the llm edge reports it for the hub's small models or an agent driver reports it for an agent: who called, which model, tokens in and out, the cost in US dollars when a price is known (the field is left out otherwise, never zero), whether it worked. Not recorded: usage has its own table. |

## `service:reflex`

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `conversation.control` | kernel | act / none | timeout 8s | message_id*, agent*, lane | 在判断要不要打断 | The owner spoke while an agent was busy: judge what to do with it (stop it, pause, say it into the running turn, or wait for the next turn). Keywords first, the small model when unclear; a failed judgment means followup. |
| `task.outcome` | kernel | act / none | timeout 8s | turn* | 在判断结果 | After a turn ended normally, label how it ended from the owner's point of view, for the island and the capsule: delivered, needs a reply, needs action in Ash, or incomplete. |

| `task.end` | owner | act / none | timeout 5s | turn*, pending_ids* | 在结束任务 | End the selected capsule interaction: stop its current turn and withdraw only the pending requests that are displayed. Never stops a newer turn. |
| `screen.plan` | kernel | act / none | timeout 15s | agent*, lane*, ids | 在判断在哪块屏幕上做 | Before a turn that the owner started opens: decide whether the turn's phone-screen work belongs on the real screen or on a background virtual screen, and give the text to put into that turn. The agent names the lane because the turn does not have an id yet. Whatever cannot be judged (no phone, no judge, unsure) is mode none with no text: the turn goes on untouched. |
| `screen.reconcile` | kernel | act / none | timeout 30s | turn*, agent*, lane*, outcome | 在收拾后台屏幕 | After a turn ended: close the virtual screen this turn opened when its work is done, if the screen state the decision saw is still current. The real screen is never touched; the owner chooses when to go back to Ash. |

| `describe` | owner, agent, app | read / none | - | body* | 在看身体详情 | One body in detail: its body.info (system, resources, work directory, ownership), disk use, and the latest error. |
| `bind` | owner, agent, app | write / structure | - | hand* | 在把电脑当作身体 | Bind a paired computer as a body: its workspace.* capabilities become available as body:<hand>. An agent asking for this goes through the gate. |

## `person:owner`

| 词 | 调用方 | effect / risk | 标记 | 输入 | 进行时 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `say` | agent, app | act / none | - | text*, kind, facts, dedupe_key | 在回你消息 | Send the owner a short message; it is acknowledged when recorded and does not wait for a reply or replace ask. kind (default reply): reply, due (a reminder), offer or heads_up (unprompted; an opaque stable dedupe_key keeps a repeat from showing twice). facts are source message or fact ids. |
| `react` | agent, app | act / none | - | message_id*, emoji* | 在给消息加表情 | React to one existing message with an emoji; an unknown message id fails. Not for a new explanation: use say for that. |
| `show` | agent, app | act / none | - | card* | 在给你看卡片 | Show the owner a file, image, link, a permission page to switch on, or choices. Showing choices does not itself authorize anything. A permission card only names an Android setting the owner must switch on; calling a capability asks the owner by itself. |
| `ask` | agent | act / none | timeout 604800s | title*, detail, human_kind, allow_custom, options, expires_at, source | 在问你 | A durable question to the owner, who must choose before something continues. Only title is required; a question (the default human_kind) also needs options, while a confirmation without options gets yes and no from the owner's side. detail, source and expires_at are optional: the gate fills them for an approval, the tools fill expires_at from approval_ttl_minutes, and the owner's side ends the question at expires_at (at most seven days). The tools human_ask and human_confirm are this word under two names and take exactly this input. The answer (or the expiry) comes back as the response; an approval does not execute anything by itself. The hub's gate uses this for approval cards. |
| `open` | agent, app | act / none | - | target*, id, mode, client | 在打开页面 | Open or suggest a page on one of the owner's channels: settings, the activity of a turn, a file (id says which). `client` picks the channel; leave it out for the one the owner is on. Check `opened`: a suggestion may be declined. |
| `typing` | kernel | read / none | event out | - | 在等你说完 | The human module tells an agent the owner is composing a message to it. |
| `widget.rendered` | kernel | read / none | event out | widgets, rendered* | 在记下卡片画出来没有 | The human module passes on what a channel reported after showing widget state, for service:widgets. |
| `widget.preview` | kernel | read / none | - | card*, size | 在画卡片预览 | Ask a channel that shows widgets to draw a card and return the picture (an image part), for service:widgets. |

## `agent:*`

| `tell` | owner, agent, app | act / none | - | text*, attachments | 在告诉帮手 | Tell the agent something. It joins the agent's back lane and the agent decides what to do with it; there is no direct answer to the sender. |
| `ask` | owner, agent, app | act / none | timeout 600s | text* | 在问帮手 | Put a question to the agent; what it says in the turn that takes the question is the answer. A quick answer is returned directly, a slow one as a receipt. |
