/**
 * The chat screen's end of the human channel (SPEC-05 §4.1). The screen ([ai.ash.ui.HumanPort], the "page" below) has no connection
 * of its own: it hands the frames it would send over a WebSocket to this bridge, which puts them on the app's one connection
 * unchanged, and what comes back on the human channel for the screen is handed to it unchanged. The messages between them are:
 *
 *  - page to native `{type:"frame", frame}`: a `send`, `sync`, `sync.close`, `presence` or `stream` frame of the human channel,
 *    or the `present.result` of a `chat` present it was given. A frame the link cannot send (no connection, or one that breaks
 *    the protocol) is answered with an `error` frame carrying the frame's `id` (or its `sid`).
 *  - native to page `{type:"frame", frame}`: `send.result`, `sync.page`, `sync.msg`, `stream`, and the `chat` presents.
 *  - native to page `{type:"link", open, client?, local?}`: the human channel opened or closed. Its syncs end with it, so the
 *    page opens them again when it opens; the same message is sent when a page attaches, and again whenever the page asks
 *    ([resendLink]): the bridge keeps the last state, so a page that came late, or missed it, only has to ask.
 *
 * Nothing in a frame is looked at, except to find the `chat` presents and to end the page's syncs when the page goes.
