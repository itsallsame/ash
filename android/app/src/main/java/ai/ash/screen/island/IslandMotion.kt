/**
 * How the island moves between states. The reference fixes the look of each state and its own marks; the transitions
 * between states follow the platforms' established patterns instead:
 *  - capsule <-> card: one spring drives width, height and corner radius together (iOS Dynamic Island; bouncier
 *    when it opens than when it closes). Material container transform for the content: the avatar is a shared element
 *    that morphs between its two places; both contents scale with the container (fit to width) and fade through (the
 *    outgoing leaves just before the incoming arrives, so two texts never overlap); they travel with it and, with
 *    the avatar staying, no frame shows an empty island.
 *  - changed text cross-fades; a changed mark shrinks out as the new one grows in (SF Symbols replace); colours blend.
 *  - a card whose content grows or shrinks springs to its new height without bounce (animateContentSize).
 *  - appearing, the island springs out of the top centre; leaving, it shrinks back into it.
 *  - with reduced motion: short cross-fades only, no spring, scale or blur (iOS Reduce Motion).
